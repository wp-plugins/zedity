== Frequently asked questions ==

**Q: Why should I use the Zedity plugin?**  
A: Zedity enables you to do things that cannot be done with the default WordPress editor. For example, you can drag and drop any element (videos, images, text, audio, etc.) anywhere and exactly how you want it,  add effects like rotation, borders, transparency, etc., all in just few clicks! Zedity has been designed to enable anyone to create impressive results that only skilled developers could do. Thank your for your interest and, if you decided to give Zedity a try, we would absolutely welcome your feedback!

**Q: How do I start using Zedity?**  
A: After installing and enabling the plugin, a new button appears in the WordPress visual editor. Just click on that ("Z") button to open Zedity, and you can start adding your content right away. Once you're done, save ("Page" -> "Save") to exit the Zedity Editor: your content is now showing among your other content in your post.

**Q: How come audio and video boxes are not playing after I exit the Zedity Editor?**  
A: No worries, that is normal behavior in WordPress: they will play normally when you publish your post.

**Q: How can I update the Zedity content after saving it?**  
A: From the standard WordPress editor, just click on the Zedity content that you want to update and then click on the Zedity icon.

**Q: Can I see any live content created with Zedity?**  
A: Sure. For example, in our WordPress Zedity Blog, the "[See it with your eyes](http://zedity.com/blog/introducing-zedity/)" section was easily created with the Zedity Plugin for WordPress.

**Q: Is Zedity available only for WordPress?**  
A: Not really. For example, Zedity is also available as a JavaScript Library. For an up-to-date list of supported platforms and versions please visit the [Zedity site](http://zedity.com).
