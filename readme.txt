Q: Why should I use the Zedity plugin?
A: Zedity enables you to do things that cannot be done with the default WordPress editor.

Zedity has been designed to enable anyone to create impressive results that only skilled developers could do. Thank your for your interest and, if you decided to give Zedity a try, we would absolutely welcome your feedback!
