== Description ==

Zedity is a content editor that enables you to enrich your WordPress site with stunning multimedia content. With the WYSIWYG drag and drop "boxes", you can easily insert text, images, videos and audio exactly how and where you want, top them with CSS3 effects, and achieve impressive results that only skilled web developers could do.
Zedity is completely HTML5 driven: with no requirement for external plugin (e.g. Flash, etc.), it is suitable for any modern computer or portable device.

== Frequently asked questions ==

**Q: Why should I use the Zedity plugin?**  
A: Zedity enables you to do things that cannot be done with the default WordPress editor. For example, you can drag and drop any element (videos, images, text, audio, etc.) exactly where you want, with total flexibility for any creative layouts, add any media, and stylish effects, all in just few clicks! Zedity has been designed to enable anyone to create impressive results, which only skilled developers could do. Thank your for your interest and, if you decided to give Zedity a try, we would absolutely welcome your feedback!

**Q: How do I start using Zedity?**  
A: After installing and enabling the plugin, a new button ("Z") appears in the WordPress visual editor. Just click on the "Z" button to open Zedity, and you can start adding your content right away. Once you're done, save ("Content" -> "Save") to exit the Zedity Editor and your content will be ready for preview or publishing. You can add Zedity content anywhere in your blog or site, as many times as you want.

**Q: How come audio and video boxes are not playing after I exit the Zedity Editor?**  
A: No worries, that is normal behavior in WordPress: they will play normally when you publish your post.

**Q: How can I update the Zedity content after saving it?**  
A: From the standard WordPress editor, just click on the Zedity content that you want to update and then click on the Zedity icon.

**Q: Can I include as many media as I want in my content?**
A: Absolutely yes. Just keep in mind that if you add many big images, then the content may end up being slower to load (just like it happens in any web-site).

**Q: Can I see any live content created with Zedity?**  
A: Sure. We happen to report some live examples on the [Zedity Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/Zedity). Yet, in our WordPress Zedity Blog, the "[See it with your eyes](http://zedity.com/blog/introducing-zedity/)" section was easily created with the Zedity Plugin for WordPress.

**Q: Is it possible to have additional video/audio services supported?**  
A: Yes, at the moment there are 20+ audio and video service supported by [Zedity Premium](http://zedity.com/plugin/wp).

== Screenshots ==

1. By clicking on the Z icon the Zedity editor opens up.
2. To get started, click on the "Add box" menu and then, for example, on "Image" to add an image.
3. Add other boxes, drag them around, add effects and eventually click on either "Save" under the "Content" menu or the Save icon.
4. In your WordPress dashboard, you can control the Zedity Settings for the default content size of your posts, the watermark position, the web fonts you intend to use in your contents, etc.
