**NEW VERSION 2.0!** Now available with **RESPONSIVE DESIGN in[Zedity Premium](http://zedity.com/plugin/wp)**


**Advantages:**

*   **Design Freedom with No More Code Struggling!**: while designing your pages, have you ever felt like "I wish I could just move this object right there" or "I'd like to put an image on the corner of this video" or any other more creative ideas? In those cases usually you have two options: either you spend enough time (money) dealing with the HTML/CSS code or you give up and let your creative idea go. With Zedity, things have finally evolved! You can now implement any creative design you need, with no limitation or constraints, just like you've been wishing for!

*   **Amazingly Easy and Flexible**: most likely you've already encountered the "drag&drop" term around, haven't you? So, what's new? As you may have found out, very often that "drag&drop" is about the way you bring items from the menu into the page but then, even simple things like placing two images beside each other, require time, efforts and technical skills. Zedity overcomes all those limitations, giving you a real Drag and Drop experience with all visual commands for maximum flexibility and ease of use!

*   **Save Time and Money**: with Zedity, not only don't you need any technical skill, but also, you can focus on the content you're creating, which is the valuable part of what you're doing, instead of wasting time struggling on how to create it. Zedity enables anyone to create much more engaging and professional content, in much less time with real drag&drop and few clicks!

*   **It works on any Modern Devices**: Zedity generates HTML5 code without using Flash or other external plugins, so your content can be shown on any device running a modern HTML5 browser (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, IE9+, Opera, Safari). The [Premium](http://zedity.com/plugin/wp) version comes with responsive scaling, to perfectly fit your responsive design!

== Frequently asked questions ==

**Q: Why should I use the Zedity plugin?**  
A: Zedity enables you to do things that cannot be done with the default WordPress editor. For example, you can drag and drop any element (videos, images, text, audio, etc.) exactly where you want, with total flexibility for any creative layouts, add any media, and stylish effects, all in just few clicks! Zedity has been designed to enable anyone to create impressive results, which only skilled developers could do. Thank your for your interest and, if you decided to give Zedity a try, we would absolutely welcome your feedback!

**Q: How do I start using Zedity?**  
A: After installing and enabling the plugin, a new button ("Z") appears in the WordPress visual editor. Just click on the "Z" button to open Zedity, and you can start adding your content right away. Once you're done, save ("Content" -> "Save") to exit the Zedity Editor and your content will be ready for preview or publishing. You can add Zedity content anywhere in your blog or site, as many times as you want.

**Q: How come audio and video boxes are not playing after I exit the Zedity Editor?**  
A: No worries, that is normal behavior in WordPress: they will play normally when you publish your post.

**Q: How can I update the Zedity content after saving it?**  
A: From the standard WordPress editor, just click on the Zedity content that you want to update and then click on the Zedity icon.

**Q: Can I include as many media as I want in my content?**  
A: Absolutely yes. Just keep in mind that if you add many big images, then the content may end up being slower to save and load. If the maximum size allowed (which depends on the system configuration) is exceeded then it may not be possible to save the content.

**Q: Is it possible to have additional video/audio services supported?**  
A: There are 20+ audio and video services supported as a premium feature in [Zedity Premium](http://zedity.com/plugin/wp).

**Q: Can I see any live content created with Zedity?**  
A: Sure. At the moment we share some live examples on our [Zedity Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/Zedity). 

**Q: Is there any tutorial about Zedity?**  
A: Yes, here is a YouTube channel where you can find some useful [Zedity Tutorials](http://www.youtube.com/user/ZedityTutorials).
