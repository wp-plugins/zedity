**Advantages:**

*   Design freedom: have you ever felt like "I wish I could just drag and drop this object right there" while creating your content? With Zedity that wish is now a reality! You can implement any creative design you want with no more layout constraints: any media (images, videos, docs, text, audios, buttons, etc.) can be placed exactly where and how you want, with drag and drop!

*   Real Drag and Drop: some web site builder or editor use to call themselves "Drag and Drop". Unfortunately, you may find out that what is drag and drop is only the way you bring items on the page but then, even simplest things like placing two images beside each other can be a stressful task. Zedity overcomes all those limitations, giving you the Drag and Drop experienced you wished for. 

*   Professional results: Zedity has been designed to be very easy but, at the same time, very flexible and powerful to enable anyone to achieve professional results.  

*   Cross-browser: Zedity generates HTML5 code that runs on any modern HTML5 browser (IE9+, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.), without using Flash or other external plugins.

*   Productivity: Zedity will impress you for the ease of creating more engaging content in a fraction of the time! Do you still need to have or hire technical skills to create your content? With Zedity, not any more!


**Boxes to design... outside the box!**

Zedity has the right box for each type of content you need while creating your design:
 
*   Audio box: to include songs, soundtracks, sound effects, voice overs, and so on. 
*   Color box: to add solid and gradient backgrounds, create shapes, etc.
*   Text box: for any textual content, links, titles, slogans, descriptions, etc.
*   Image box: to add images, including online images, with built-in effects and filters.
*   Video box: to include videos with Zedity flexibility and options for creative designs and effects. 
*   Document box ([Premium](http://zedity.com/plugin/wp)): add online documents like slideshare, scribd, google_viewer, PDF documents, Microsoft Office documents, Apple Pages, Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, and more.
*   Html5 box ([Premium](http://zedity.com/plugin/wp)): the ultimate piece of flexibility! An example: have you got a PayPal button and you'd like it the Zedity way? Just copy paste the PayPal code into this box and the magic is done. The Html box gives you total power and endless possibilities!

== Frequently asked questions ==

**Q: Why should I use the Zedity plugin?**  
A: Zedity enables you to do things that cannot be done with the default WordPress editor. For example, you can drag and drop any element (videos, images, text, audio, etc.) exactly where you want, with total flexibility for any creative layouts, add any media, and stylish effects, all in just few clicks! Zedity has been designed to enable anyone to create impressive results, which only skilled developers could do. Thank your for your interest and, if you decided to give Zedity a try, we would absolutely welcome your feedback!

**Q: How do I start using Zedity?**  
A: After installing and enabling the plugin, a new button ("Z") appears in the WordPress visual editor. Just click on the "Z" button to open Zedity, and you can start adding your content right away. Once you're done, save ("Content" -> "Save") to exit the Zedity Editor and your content will be ready for preview or publishing. You can add Zedity content anywhere in your blog or site, as many times as you want.

**Q: How come audio and video boxes are not playing after I exit the Zedity Editor?**  
A: No worries, that is normal behavior in WordPress: they will play normally when you publish your post.

**Q: How can I update the Zedity content after saving it?**  
A: From the standard WordPress editor, just click on the Zedity content that you want to update and then click on the Zedity icon.

**Q: Can I include as many media as I want in my content?**  
A: Absolutely yes. Just keep in mind that if you add many big images, then the content may end up being slower to save and load. If the maximum size allowed (which depends on the system configuration) is exceeded then it may not be possible to save the content.

**Q: Is it possible to have additional video/audio services supported?**  
A: There are 20+ audio and video services supported as a premium feature in [Zedity Premium](http://zedity.com/plugin/wp).

**Q: Can I see any live content created with Zedity?**  
A: Sure. At the moment we share some live examples on our [Zedity Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/Zedity). 

**Q: Is there any tutorial about Zedity?**  
A: Yes, here is a YouTube channel where you can find some useful [Zedity Tutorials](http://www.youtube.com/user/ZedityTutorials). 


== Screenshots ==

1. By clicking on the Z icon the Zedity editor opens up.
